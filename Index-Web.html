<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
  (URLs, such as <a href="https://www.example.com/" target="_blank" title="This is an Example">https://www.example.com/)</a>, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the <u>Internet.</u></P>
  <p>The resources of the WWW are transferred via the <font color="blue">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</font> and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>

<p>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991. </p>
<p><u>The World Wide Web</u> has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.</p>
